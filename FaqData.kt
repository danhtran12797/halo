An offshore company allows you to  quickly create a stable structure with a simple administration and enjoy all  the benefits of the offshore jurisdiction.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Commerce over the internet (e-commerce)</h2>\\r\\n<p>Internet  traders can use an offshore company to maintain a domain name and to manage internet  sites. An offshore company might be ideal for people whose business is on the internet.  You might choose to incorporate the registered office of your company in an  offshore jurisdiction to take advantage of the various benefits offered by  these jurisdictions.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Consultants/counsellors</h2>\\r\\n<p>You  can also carry on your consultancy or counselling business through an offshore  company. You will find it easier to manage your company, while being registered  in a stable jurisdiction and benefiting from all the strengths of that  jurisdiction.</p>\\r\\n<h2>International business</h2>\\r\\n<p>International  commerce can be carried out through an offshore company.

In addition to confidentiality, the  benefits and advantages they offer include exemption from certain types of  taxes (e.g. inheritance tax). It should be noted, however, that some countries  do not allow the acquisition of movable/immovable property through offshore  structures and therefore those wishing to form an offshore structure are  advised to check with a competent authority before proceeding.</p>\\r\\n<h2>For inheritance purposes</h2>\\r\\n<p>An  offshore firm that always stays afloat (provided all costs associated with  running it are paid) may, in some countries, be used as a means of avoiding  inheritance-tax laws. With a view to minimising inheritance-tax liability, the  offshore structure may also be combined with a trust or a foundation.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Stockbroker/forex</h2>\\r\\n<p>Offshore  companies are very often used for share dealing or foreign-exchange  transactions.
